Aim

I designed and simulated a smart city environment in Cisco Packet Tracer that allows monitoring and automation of street lights, fire alarms, and surveillance cameras using IoT technology.

Problem Statement

Modern cities face challenges in safety, energy efficiency, and quick emergency response. Conventional systems are inefficient and lack automation. This project demonstrates how IoT can improve city infrastructure through smart surveillance, intelligent street lighting, and fire monitoring in a simulated smart city environment.

Scope of the Solution

Provides smart surveillance with IoT cameras.

Enables intelligent street lighting that works automatically based on time or motion.

Implements fire monitoring with sensors and alarm systems.

Centralized control and monitoring through an IoT server dashboard.

Required Components

Cisco Packet Tracer software

IoT Server (Home Gateway)

Router & Switch

IoT Camera (for surveillance)

Smart Lamp (street lighting)

Motion Detector / Light Sensor (for lamp automation)

Smoke Detector / Fire Sensor (for fire monitoring)

Alarm (for emergency alert)

PC/Tablet (for monitoring dashboard)

Files Included

Smart_City.pkt → Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file

demo_screenshot.png → Screenshot of the IoT dashboard with devices

demo_video.mp4 (optional) → Recording of demo simulation

How to Run

Open the Smart_City.pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Use the PC/Tablet to access the IoT Monitor.

Test the system by:

Triggering night mode → Street lights turn ON.

Detecting motion → Street lights turn ON.

Simulating fire/smoke → Alarm activates.

Viewing live surveillance via IoT camera.
